# Oboeru
Learn Kanji. Practice for the 漢検.

Oboeru is designed to help you learn how to read and write kanji, and pick up some new vocabulary along the way.
The content is based on the material used to study for Japan's Kanken 漢検 examinations. So far, there is support for part of level 8. The goal is that levels 10, 9 and 8 will be fully supported by the time v1 goes live.

Oboeru lets you test your knowledge of the on and kun readings of kanji in several example sentences. You can also create your own custom study sets as well. The game theme comes from the Japanese TV show Neptune League, where contestans must provide the pronunciation of a kanji or draw it correctly in order to advance to the next stage.

While drawing of kanji is currently supported, there is currently no support for validating that a submitted drawing is correct. This is due to the lack of JS OCR libraries that can accurately detect Japanese and Chinese inputs. As such, it's currently up to you to grade yourself when it comes to drawing kanji.

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome. Feel free to leave a comment or an issue on this repo.
